# Medico - The Perfect Solution for predecting Heart Disease.

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Introducing the perfect solution for predicting heart disease MEDICO.

A Machine Learning Project which aims to predict the likelihood of an individual suffering from heart disease based on input features such as age, sex, chest pain type (CP), resting blood pressure (trased bps), cholesterol levels, slope of the ST segment during exercise (slope), maximum heart rate achieved during exercise (thalack), and exercise-induced angina (exang).

The machine learning model employed for this prediction is trained on a labeled dataset of heart disease patients. It utilizes a combination of classification algorithms to analyze the provided input and deliver a binary outcome indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

By providing these features as input, users can receive an instant report regarding their heart health status. This project offers a user-friendly and efficient solution for early detection and prevention of heart disease, potentially enabling individuals to take proactive measures to safeguard their cardiovascular health.
